      <h2>Reflection:</h2>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b
          >Your design's guiding values and how they were embodied in the UI.</b
        >
      </li>
      <p>
        My design's guiding values were simplicity, clarity, and
        user-friendliness. I aimed to create a clean and intuitive interface
        that allows users to navigate easily and find information quickly. The
        use of a minimalist color scheme and straightforward layout helped
        embody these values in the UI.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Immersion and Flow:</li>
        <p>
          The UI prioritizes a clean, uncluttered interface that focuses user
          attention on the central instrument grid, fostering a sense of
          immersion through subtle tactile animations and glowing feedback
          effects. This design choice ensures the interactions are responsive
          and engaging.
        </p>
        <li>Learnability and Progressive Disclosure:</li>
        <p>
          For learnability, the UI incorporates optional overlays for note names
          and keyboard shortcuts. It allows users to access guidance without
          overwhelming the interface, while experienced users can also disable
          them for a better experience. There's also visual cues, such as
          diamond borders to differentiated octave starts. This help users build
          spatial memory across the grid, making the layout progressively more
          intuitive as they interact.
        </p>
        <li>Customization and Accessibility:</li>
        <p>
          The design emphasizes user control through a customizable keymap
          system, enabling personalized input mappings. Keyboard navigation
          includes shortcuts like Shift+S for settings and Escape to close
          panels.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <li>
        <b
          >Your rationale in designing your UI's feedback, information design,
          mapping and learnability.</b
        >
      </li>
      <p>
        For feedback, I incorporated visual cues such as key changes and
        animations to indicate user actions and system responses. Visual
        feedback is immediate and tactile: keys scale, glow, and display effects
        on press, providing clear response for interactions. The "Surprise Me"
        feature provides an unpredictable feedback that encourages exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information design was structured to prioritize essential content,
        making it easy for users to find what they need. The grid layout uses a
        3x5 structure, covering notes from C4 to C6. Explicit instructional text
        in the UI clarifies usage and shortcuts, while the diamond border on
        octave starts serves as a subtle informational anchor, reducing
        cognitive load by highlighting key structural elements without clutter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default keymap aligns QWERTY/ASDFG/ZXCVB keys with the left-to-right
        note progression, creating intuitive spatial mapping that mirrors
        physical keyboard layouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learnability was enhanced by providing tooltips and onboarding guides
        for new users. Toggleable overlays for labels and shortcuts enable
        progressive disclosure, allowing users to build a learning framework and
        remove assistive tools as proficiency increases. This make the user
        interface accessible to beginners while also scalable for advanced
        users.
      </p>

      <li>
        <b>Any significant changes since your work in progress milestone.</b>
      </li>
      <p>
        Since my work in progress milestone, I made several significant changes
        to improve the overall user experience. I got insipired from Apple's
        Liquid Ui and changed my buttons to enhance visual appeal and
        accessibility. I also added more interactive elements to engage users
        and provide a more dynamic experience. Moreover, I added a full custom
        key mapping editor. This idea came from the feedback I recevied,
        recognizing the importance of personalization. This change successfully
        improved accessibility but it also requires many modifications to my
        code.
      </p>

      <li>
        <b
          >Your navigation of the production timeline and how you spent your
          development time.
        </b>
      </li>
      <p>
        The production timeline can be divided into four phases. Phase 1 focused
        on the core prototype, building the grid and the basic settings panels.
        Phase 2 involved UI iterations, using the idea of Liquid UI and also
        implement the light and dark mode. Phase 3 include UX iterations, such
        as adding more features to the settings panel. Add new features that was
        inspired from the feedback such as customize keyboard control and
        switching instruments. Phase 4 is fixing the bugs such as the metronome
        cannot stop after playing and other small errors.
      </p>

      <li><b>The design aspect that you are most proud of. </b></li>
      <p>
        The custom keymap system with live label synchronization stands out as
        the aspect I'm most proud of. It creates a seamless, end-to-end user
        experience; from editing mappings in the "#keyboardMappingPanel",
        sanitizing inputs to prevent conflicts "sanitizeKeymap()", saving to
        "localStorage", and instantly reflecting changes on the keys
        "updateKeyboardShortcutLabels()". This feature not only increases
        personalization and accessibility, but also provides powerful
        performance, giving users more autonomy while maintaining reasonable
        default settings. It elevates the UI from a simple tool to an adaptable
        instrument, and implementing the conflict resolution logic was
        particularly satisfying as it ensured reliability without compromising
        usability.
      </p>

      <li><b>The design aspect you found most challenging.</b></li>
      <p>
        The most challenging part of this assignment was the aesthetics,
        particularly the liquid glass UI. At first I didn't thought that it will
        be hard to code. However, I found it challenging as I cannot write out
        the code that really acts like the liquid glass. I could only try to
        recreate its appearance as closely as possible which I felt quite upset
        because it doesn't feel as transparrent as the liquid glass UI should
        be.
